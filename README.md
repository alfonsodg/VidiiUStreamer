VidiiUStreamer
==============

Server software for streaming video files (TV Shows, mainly) to the WiiU.

Roadmap
======

0.9 (next version)
==================
* Bug Fixes (Address not being correct 100% of the time, line down middle of WiiU UI)
* Sub-Directory support
* Transcoding (might be pushed to 0.9.5 if the bugs seem to be affecting lots of people.)
* Simple Browser Based server GUI (also might be pushed, will fix the "crashing means it's working" stupidity)
* Code clean up before full release (not really a feature but hey. it always needs done.) 

1.0 (Full Release)
=================
* Enhanced Support for Movies! (MAYBE making calls to the Rotten Tomatoes API to get posters + other details. No promises though.)
* Advanced Browser Based server GUI (Setup allows for choice of port number, changes to the pattern matching for TV show name detection, ect)
* Changes to the WiiU GUI to integrate Movies (I have plans for the Movies section to look LOVELY)

1.1
===

* 1.0 Bug Fixes, presumably.
